# Stage 07 Source Of Truth

## Status

- Document status: active Stage07 planning source of truth
- Scope: Telegram Mini App and desktop browser UI for the generic workspace, Bitable and digital-employee platform
- Current Progress: 2026-07-10 detailed documentation package is ready for user review after user-approved discovery, visual direction and Stage07 component boundaries. No UI code or backend contract change is authorized yet.

## 1. Stage Goal

Stage07 makes the Stage06 backend-ready platform usable through one responsive React/Vite application. It must make the table system, permission system, record-change drafts and audits visible and operable without changing their authority boundaries.

```text
verified identity -> workspace member -> permission-filtered UI
-> Workspace Home -> Base/table/view/record
-> Bot proposal -> record_change_draft -> explicit confirmation -> audit
```

## 2. Confirmed Direction

- One Workspace Home serves builders, managers, operators and viewers through permission-aware visibility.
- The Home is queue-first: assigned records, drafts, `@` mentions and controlled follow-ups dominate; recent Bases are supporting context.
- `Work Queue Atlas` is the selected Home visual parent; `Workspace Ledger` is the selected Base/table canvas; `Conversation Desk` is the selected Bot and draft-review direction.
- Desktop is the primary surface for building, imports, schema/view configuration and governance. Mobile is the primary surface for processing, confirmation, record detail and Bot conversation.
- True white, cool gray, restrained azure blue, fine separators, compact UI typography and 8px radii are mandatory. Dark AI dashboards, decorative gradients, glows and card walls are forbidden.

Stage06 is the backend contract baseline. Stage02-05 documents are historical capability evidence only.

## 4. Delivery Packages

| Package | Outcome | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. UI foundation | App shell, verified identity bootstrap, responsive tokens, global loading/error/denied states | existing Stage06 identity/permission contract works in the target environment |
| 2. Workspace and Bitable surface | queue-first Home, Bases, saved views, records, builders, import/template experiences | every interaction has an existing authorized durable resource endpoint |
| 3. Governance surface | members, roles, permissions, audit readback and configuration UI | no hidden field/resource is leaked in client data or UI state |
| 4. Digital employee surface | Bot contacts, personal assistant, field-level draft review and Telegram handoff | proposed employee/knowledge/memory contract is separately approved |

## 5. Required Scope

- Workspace switcher, member bootstrap and permission-aware navigation.
- Workspace Home queues: assigned records, draft confirmations, `@` mentions, controlled notifications and recent Bases.
- Base/table/view/record interactions for Grid, Kanban, Calendar and Form without changing saved semantics.
- Full builder configuration for Base/table/field/view, template/import and member/role/permission surfaces on desktop; lower-density but complete mobile pathways.
- Team Bot contact directory, personal assistant context picker and draft confirmation UI.
- Loading, empty, denied, expired-session, network-error and conflict states.
- Telegram deep links that resolve only after identity, workspace membership and resource authorization are checked.

## 6. Explicit Contract Gate

Stage06 currently provides base-bound `DigitalEmployee` resources. The following are Stage07 proposals, not approved implementation work:

- workspace-level team Bot contacts with multiple Base/table/view scopes;
- personal assistant resource model;
- Bot draft/test/published lifecycle and Telegram group/contact bindings;
- curated knowledge-source registration and permission-filtered retrieval;
- per-user Bot memory partitions and retention/clear controls;
- Mini App verified identity and deep-link bootstrap contract.

No schema migration, API endpoint, authorization rule or permission model for this list may be implemented without a dedicated technical decision and explicit user confirmation.

## 7. Non-Goals

- Feishu/Lark integration or API compatibility;
- direct AI writes, self-confirmation or audit bypass;
- unrestricted memory, arbitrary knowledge crawling or unfiltered document retrieval;
- production launch, broad Telegram sends, provider writes, funds movement or account operations;
- replacing the confirmed React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + lucide-react baseline.

## 8. Stage Exit

Stage07 may be accepted only when its BDD, visual QA, responsive flows, permission-denial behavior and controlled-draft lifecycle pass against approved contracts. A production release remains a later, separate gate.
